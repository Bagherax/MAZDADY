# MAZDADY
MAZDADY is a mythic Android and Flask project that ritualizes every technical act as a legacy moment. Designed for operational clarity, manual sovereignty, and modular expansion, it empowers creators to unify structure, verify resources, and build with cosmic intent. Every function is mapped, every error is sacred, and every success is silent.
